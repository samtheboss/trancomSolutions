*one of the main advantage of Hibernate jpa framework over jdbc is that Hibernate jpa data is represented
    by classes  and objects rather than by tables and records as in jdbc
*Hibernate JPA allows you to avoid writing DDL in a database specific dialect of SQL.
 Instead you write "mappings" in XML, or using Java annotations.
*Hibernate JPA allows you to avoid writing DML in the database specific dialect of SQL.
* Hibernate JPA allows you to load and save Java objects and graphs without any DML language at all.
*When you do need to perform queries JPQL allows you to express
 the queries in terms of the Java entities rather than the (native) SQL tables and columns.
